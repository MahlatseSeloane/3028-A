        <h1>The Promise and Peril of User Generated Content</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>
            We live in an age where almost everyone on earth has a smartphone. Smartphones have changed the way we live, from 
            the time we wake up to the time we go to sleep, smartphones are with us all the way. They help us in doing many 
            jobs that earlier required efforts and consumed our precious time. And through the installation of apps, the list 
            of possible smartphone uses multiples by tens of thousands and grows every day.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            There are apps for every task that you want to do that can be downloaded on either your phone, tablet or computer 
            that help do everyday tasks quicker. From paying your electricity bills, credit card bill, booking travel tickets 
            and so much more. Some of these apps are social media based. These generally involve messaging, photo-sharing and 
            interactive content, in real-time. The most common of these social media apps are social networks such as Twitter, 
            Facebook, LinkedIn which specialize in sharing links and short written messages, and media sharing sites such as 
            Instagram, Tik-Tok, YouTube which optimize the sharing of photos and videos.
        </p>

        <p>
            These are considered user generated content applications. User Generated Content (UGC), alternatively known as 
            User Created Content (UCC) is any form of content, such as images, videos, text, audio and reviews, that has been 
            posted by users on online platforms such as social media and wikis [1]. With these platforms available to everyone,
            now nearly anyone who has the power to capture quality content due to smartphones, is able to create, curate, and 
            share their content with others online. Long gone are the days where all content we consume is created by 
            professionals (photographers, videographers, designers, etc.) for large corporations, ad agencies and the like.

        <p>
            There is no doubt that Social media and User Generated Content has its advantages, from sharing one’s thoughts, 
            ideas as well as communicating with people around the world. However, like most things, User Generated Content also 
            contains some unwanted elements or disadvantages. The following are a few of the advantages and disadvantages of the
            User Generated Content.
        </p>

        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <br>

        <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
            Connectivity – People can connect, learn, and share thoughts with anyone, regardless of the location. Social media 
            helps people to build and participate in the different kinds of communities and thereby gain a perspective they would 
            otherwise not have been able to gain. 
        </p>
        </li>

        <p>
            Information and Updates – People can update themselves with the latest happenings around in the world in real time. 
            These days, television and print media are biased and do not convey the true message. With the help of social media, 
            people can get the facts and true information by doing their own research.
        </p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
        <br>

        <p>
            Privacy Issues – Social media platforms have access to people personal accounts. Not only that, but they can monitor 
            a person’s post, who and what they interact with, and where they are in the real world. And if they choose to, they 
            can sell this information to companies which use this data to show you adverts based on that information. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Cyberbullying – Since anyone can create a fake account and do anything without being traced, it has become quite easy 
            for anyone to bully on the Internet. Threats, intimidation messages and rumours can be sent to the masses to create 
            discomfort and chaos in the society.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Reputation – With the use of social media, someone’s reputation can easily be ruined where someone with malicious 
            intent can just create a false story and spread it across the social media. Similarly, businesses can also suffer losses
             due to bad reputation being conveyed over the social media.
        </p>

        <p>
            These are just a few of the advantages and disadvantages of social media and User Generated Content. Like many other 
            tools we use, there are a lot of pros and cons about social media and User Generated Content; it’s just how we choose 
            to handle it and how we have to be prepared for the negatives as well.
