        <h1>A few things I wish I knew before I started to university</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>
            With 3 years of university currently under my belt I’ve had plenty of learning opportunities and times to reflect 
            on my experience so far. I have learned a lot of new things since beginning my course, so I’m going to share a 
            little of my wisdom with all of you whether you’re still in the application process or are a couple of months 
            into your first year.
        </p>

        <p>
            1.	Start working from day 1 
                This cannot be emphasized enough. Okay maybe if it is introduction lectures then you can relax a bit. But as 
                soon as you do work you need to get into a routine because it is very important that you start learning from 
                day 1 how to work, when to work, what is the most effective way to work, then the easier it will be able to 
                study towards a test or your exam and you won't be panicking and trying to cram six weeks of work in 1 night. 
                Even if you start off small where you spend one hour working, at the end of the day that is fine because at least 
                it's something and it will eventually build up towards the end of the semester or towards the end of the year, 
                allowing you to cope. 
        </p>

        <p>
            2.	Arrive early for class
                If you go into class, which you should, arrive early. It isn’t smart to arrive 10 minutes late to class because 
                it is going to be difficult to sit down and focus because you’ve missed the introduction and you don't know what
                the lecturer is talking. And in some cases, your lecturer might even close the doors 10 minutes after they arrive 
                to prevent any disruptions during the lecture. Learn how to arrive early from 1st year then it will be easier to 
                carry on with that throughout. 
        </p>

        <p>
            3.	There will always be another party 
                Missing a party, especially in university isn’t that big of a deal because there will always be another one, and 
                it will be the same as the one you missed. So, it is not smart to go to a party because you have FOMO (fear of 
                missing out) especially if the upcoming week you have an assignment due or exam coming up. That is the time you
                need to focus and get your work done. There will be parties, every Friday, Saturday, and sometimes even Sundays
        </p>

        <p>
            4.	Do not approach your work with the same mentality for high school 
                You cannot really approach the work the same attitude/mentality that you did in high school because the work is 
                not the same, therefore in some cases, you cannot use the same methods because the work is different and it's going 
                be 10 times more. And unlike high school, everything will depend on you as your lecturers aren’t going to give you 
                homework, well maybe sometimes but definitely not all of the time. it's going to depend on you as you will need to 
                decide what you need to work on, how much work you need to put in, figure out what you know and what you don't know. 
                In high school, this is something you never had to do because you were always told step-by-step what to do until you 
                got to the test or your exam. But now it's up to you, everything is up to you, therefore the mentality needs to change. 
        </p>

            5. Do not compare on yourself 
                There are going to be some students that study every day, even during the weekend. They are going to be speaking 
                about schoolwork and assignments non-stop, and it will feel like you should be like them, waking up on a Saturday 
                morning to go study or studying every single night. Do not put too much pressure on yourself by comparing yourself 
                to them as you know how much time you need to put into your work. You know where your strength and weaknesses lie. 
                Work according to your own pace, even if doing it's the smallest amount of work every day. You might find that when 
                the test comes, you did just as good, if not better as them by putting in less time because you work effectively.
