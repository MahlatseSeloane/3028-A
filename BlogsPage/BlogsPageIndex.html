        <h2>A few things i wish i knew before i started to university</h2>
        <p>
            With 3 years of university currently under my belt I’ve had plenty of learning opportunities and times to reflect 
            on my experience so far. I have learned a lot of new things since beginning my course, so I’m going to share a 
            little of my wisdom with all of you whether you’re still in the application process or are a couple of months 
            into your first year.

        <h2>The Promise and Peril of User Generated Content</h2>
        <p>We live in an age where almost everyone on earth has a smartphone. Smartphones have changed the way we live, 
           from the time we wake up to the time we go to sleep, smartphones are with us all the way. They help us in doing
           many jobs that earlier required efforts and consumed our precious time. And through the installation of apps, the 
           list of possible smartphone uses multiples by tens of thousands and grows every day.

        <h2>A reflection on McLuhan, M. ‘The Medium is the Message’</h2>
        <p>
            “The medium is the message”. This is a phrase that many people, including myself have struggled to comprehend. 
            It is a phrase coined by Marshall McLuhan, a Canadian philosopher, whose work is among the cornerstones of the 
            study of media theory. The phrase serves as the title of  the first  chapter of his book, Understanding Media: 
            The Extensions of Man, published in 1964. The book is considered a pioneering study in media theory.
