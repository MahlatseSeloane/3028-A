        <h1>About The Website</h1>

        <p>
            Hey! My name is Kgothatso Modupe. I am 21 years old South African living in Soweto, Johannesburg. I have lived in Soweto 
            my entire life with my Mom, Dad, and younger brother. There is a saying in my hood, and it goes, “you can take me out of 
            the hood, but you can’t take the hood out of me”, and this personifies me to my core. No matter where I am or who I am with, 
            I will always be the same Kgothatso that grow up in Soweto, the greatest “hood” in the world.
        </p>
