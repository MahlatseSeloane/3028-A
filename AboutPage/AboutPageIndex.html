                            Hey! My name is Kgothatso Modupe. I am 21 years old South African living in Soweto, Johannesburg. I have lived in Soweto 
                            my entire life with my Mom, Dad, and younger brother. There is a saying in my hood, and it goes, “you can take me out of 
                            the hood, but you can’t take the hood out of me”, and this personifies me to my core. No matter where I am or who I am with, 
                            I will always be the same Kgothatso that grow up in Soweto, the greatest “hood” in the world.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            I am currently an Undergraduate student at the University of the Witwatersrand, studying towards a Bachelor of Commerce with 
                            Law degree. I am an adventurer at heart. I love traveling, eating good food, snapping photos, and spending time with my 
                            favourite people.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            I created Kgothatso’s Adventures as a blog and a platform that is dedicated to sharing my journey. That includes my experiences 
                            living in Soweto, becoming a young adult, going to university, and so much more. This is in the hopes to tell my story, teach 
                            myself what i do not know and to articulate what i do know, and hopefully expose myself to new things, new people, and new 
                            opportunities.
