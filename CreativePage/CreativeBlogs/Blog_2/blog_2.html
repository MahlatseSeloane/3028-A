                        <p>
                            With 3 years of university currently under my belt I’ve had plenty of learning opportunities and times to reflect 
                            on my experience so far. I have learned a lot of new things since beginning my course, so I’m going to share a 
                            little of my wisdom with all of you whether you’re still in the application process or are a couple of months 
                            into your first year.
                        </p>

                        <h3>1.	Start working from day 1 </h3>
                        <p>
                            This cannot be emphasized enough. Okay maybe if it is introduction lectures then you can relax a bit. But as 
                            soon as you do work you need to get into a routine because it is very important that you start learning from 
                            day 1 how to work, when to work, what is the most effective way to work, then the easier it will be able to 
                            study towards a test or your exam and you won't be panicking and trying to cram six weeks of work in 1 night. 
                            Even if you start off small where you spend one hour working, at the end of the day that is fine because at least 
                            it's something and it will eventually build up towards the end of the semester or towards the end of the year, 
                            llowing you to cope. 
                        </p>
        
                        <h3>2.	Arrive early for class</h3>
                        <p>
                            If you go into class, which you should, arrive early. It isn’t smart to arrive 10 minutes late to class because 
                            it is going to be difficult to sit down and focus because you’ve missed the introduction and you don't know what
                            the lecturer is talking. And in some cases, your lecturer might even close the doors 10 minutes after they arrive 
                            to prevent any disruptions during the lecture. Learn how to arrive early from 1st year then it will be easier to 
                            carry on with that throughout. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>3.	There will always be another party </h3>
                        <p>
                            Missing a party, especially in university isn’t that big of a deal because there will always be another one, and 
                            it will be the same as the one you missed. So, it is not smart to go to a party because you have FOMO (fear of 
                            missing out) especially if the upcoming week you have an assignment due or exam coming up. That is the time you
                            need to focus and get your work done. There will be parties, every Friday, Saturday, and sometimes even Sundays
                        </p>

                        <h3>4.	Do not approach your work with the same mentality for high school </h3>
                        <p>
                            
                            You cannot really approach the work the same attitude/mentality that you did in high school because the work is 
                            not the same, therefore in some cases, you cannot use the same methods because the work is different and it's going 
                            be 10 times more. And unlike high school, everything will depend on you as your lecturers aren’t going to give you 
                            homework, well maybe sometimes but definitely not all of the time. it's going to depend on you as you will need to 
                            decide what you need to work on, how much work you need to put in, figure out what you know and what you don't know. 
                            In high school, this is something you never had to do because you were always told step-by-step what to do until you 
                            got to the test or your exam. But now it's up to you, everything is up to you, therefore the mentality needs to change. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>5. Do not compare on yourself with other students</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are going to be some students that study every day, even during the weekend. They are going to be speaking 
                            about schoolwork and assignments non-stop, and it will feel like you should be like them, waking up on a Saturday 
                            morning to go study or studying every single night. Do not put too much pressure on yourself by comparing yourself 
                            to them as you know how much time you need to put into your work. You know where your strength and weaknesses lie. 
                            Work according to your own pace, even if doing it's the smallest amount of work every day. You might find that when 
                            the test comes, you did just as good, if not better as them by putting in less time because you work effectively. 
                        </p>    

                        <h3>6. Go through the course work before a lecture </h3>
                        <p>
                            This is because unlike teachers, lecturers expect students to have gone through the work before coming to class. 
                            Again, something that I was told by my teachers in high school but like any other learner at the time, did not take 
                            seriously.
                        </p>

                        <h3>7. Ask for help</h3>
                        <p>
                            This cannot be stressed enough, when  the importance of asking for help 
                        </p>
