                        <p>
                            When you are new to Johannesburg, the first thing that people usually tell you is be vigilant and open your eyes because if you don't, there is a high chance that you will get robbed. For me, this was something I already knew, and nobody needed to tell me because I had been to Jozi so many times before, with my mom, my friends, and sometimes even alone. So, when I got robbed coming back from school with my friend Nomthandazo, I couldn’t believe it. I’m sure if my friends knew how it happened, all the street cred I had built up growing up would disappear in an instant. Anyway, here is the story of how it happened. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It was a Wednesday, and it began like any other day. I woke up, went to take a bath and brush my teeth, got dressed, ate breakfast with my family, and then prepared for school, you know, the usual stuff. Now because I was still living at home, I had to catch a taxi to go to school and the taxi usually takes about an hour to get to Jozi, considering the traffic in the morning. So, to pass time, I would put on my earphones and listen to music just to set the vibe of the day, and to avoid having people talk to me in the taxi. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So, we get there, and I get off at the taxi rank, which is the same place I go to catch a taxi back home. Now to get to school from the taxi rank I need to pass the Mandela Bridge, so I do just that. I start walking towards the bridge and as I'm walking, I notice that today is busier than most days, but I shrug It off because it's in the morning and people are either going to school or to work. So, then I continue walking and I pass the Mandela bridge. I get to school and go to attend my first lecture of the day. So far, everything is normal. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now on Wednesdays I have two lectures and a tutorial, then I’m done for the day. After the tutorial, my friends and I go get lunch and we chill for a bit. And then after an hour, one of my friends, Nomthandazo and I normally go to the computer lab to do a tutorial quiz that we have every week and is due on Thursday, the next day. This had become like a routine for us.  So, we go there and start working on the quiz, separately. An hour into it, I realise that today’s quiz is harder than the ones that came before. So, I go to Nomthandazo who is sitting at a different computer station, to see how she’s doing. Turns out she’s also struggling. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So, we decide to sit together and work on this quiz. A few hours pass and it was now 5:30 pm, we had done most of the questions, but because it was way past the time we tend to leave school as both of us stayed at home, we decided it best to leave and do the rest of the quiz individually. Usually, we leave school before 5 pm to avoid the frenzy and the long queues at the taxi rank as people have knocked off from work and high school students are heading home as well. So, we then packed our things and left the computer lab, and as we got outside, the sun had gone down a little and it was a bit windy. I then tell Nomthandazo that we should hurry because I only had a light jersey on, and I was cold. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We then walk across campus towards an exit, and as we do Nomthandazo is cracking jokes, trying to distract me from the cold. They were not as funny as she thought they were. We then get to the exit and start heading for the bridge as the taxi rank is on the other side. At this time, there’s a handful of people around due to it being cold. We eventually get to the bridge. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now for the record, like I said before, I’ve been to Jozi multiple times, so I’m not a new to it, but I’ve never been there long enough for me to see Mandela bridge with its lights on.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So as soon as I see that the lights are on, i instantly take out my phone and ask Nomthandazo to take a picture of me on the bridge. I will admit, this was a bad idea, and I should have known better, but the excitement got the better of me. Luckily though, nothing happened. Nomthandazo took a couple of pictures and gave me back the phone. Some were okay but others were blurry as hell, but because it was cold, I was not keen to take some more. We then continue crossing the bridge and as we do, I then notice a couple of guys walking towards us. This is where the problems started. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Okay to avoid making the story long, let’s stop it here and I’ll continue another time.
