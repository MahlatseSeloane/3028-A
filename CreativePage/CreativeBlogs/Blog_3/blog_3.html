                            Hey what’s up guys, welcome back to Kgothatso’s Adventures. I Hope everyone is doing great and having a blessed day. Today I’m going to continue with the story of when I got robbed on the Mandela Bridge.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Just a quick recap. It was a Wednesday, and it began like any other day. My friend Nomthandazo and I were working on a tutorial quiz which was due the next day. While working on it, we lose track of time, and didn’t realise it was getting late. Eventually we did realise and decide to leave as both of us stay at home and must catch a taxi. As we get outside, its dark and windy. We start heading towards the bridge as the taxi rank is on the other side. But now, because the bridge has it’s lights on, I ask Nomthandazo to take pictures of me on the bridge. After taking pictures, she gives me back my phone and we start walking. As we conitnue crossing the bridge I realise there’s a couple of guys on the other side coming this way. And that’s where I ended the story. There, you’re all caught up. Now let me continue with the story.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So, there’s four of them. Normally, this would put me on alert, but for some reason, my senses were off. Maybe it was because of the excitement, or maybe it was because Nomthandazo was still cracking her bad jokes. As we move closer and closer, I realise that the pathway on the bridge is not wide enough to fit all of us and we are going to end up bumping into each other as we cross paths, so I then jump onto a little platform on the bridge to make space, but to my surprise, one of the guys also jumps on it. In my head I’m like what the heck is this, doesn’t he see what I’m trying to do. And then in the corner of my eye on the left, I see two or three people walking on the road, where the cars go. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So, turn to them, trying to figure out why they are walking there, and then it finally clicks, they are trying to avoid getting robbed. Because the pathway on the bridge is to narrow, there is no where to run if you encountered thieves. But I had realised this too late, the four guys were on us as soon as I turned my head back. Then the one on platform with me started telling me to give him my phone and all the money I had while tapping my pockets in my jeans trying to find where I put my phone. But because Nomthandazo had just given it to me, I had put it in my jersey pocket instead of my jeans. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now because of where the environment I grew up in and the things I’ve seen, I don’t scare easy, even though I’m a girl. So as the guy is searching my jean pockets, I take out my phone and hold it in my hand. He then tries to take it but because I was taller than him, I hold it above my head, away from him. I know, I know, it wasn’t a wise decision as things could have ended badly but I couldn’t help it. Anyway, we then start struggling for the phone, and as we do so, I look back to make sure that the phone is tightly in my hand and as I do, I see that the other three guys are facing Nomthandazo and one of them has a gun to her face. It was at this point that I realised that I was putting not only my life in danger, but hers as well. I was not considering the consequences that would come as a result of my actions. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I then lower my hand and then give this guy my phone and he put it in his pocket then went back to searching my pockets for money. He finds R50 which I was going to use as taxi fare. He takes it and puts it in his pocket as well. He then asks me if I have any money elsewhere, and I tell him no. But of course, I was lying because that morning, my mom had given me R500 and asked me to buy something for her at the taxi rank and I had it in the smallest pocket in my jeans on the front, but the was no way I was going to tell this guy as he just took my phone and my taxi fare money. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now I know this was a dangerous thing to do but I only lied because I figured that he didn’t know about it as he had gone through all of my pockets and didn’t find it. He looks straight into my eyes for what felt like 30 minutes but was only more like 4 seconds, to see if I was lying, and then gets down from the platform we were on and walks towards where Nomthandazo and the other three are. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The other three were still searching for other valuables that Nomthandazo might have had. They had already taken her phone, and her purse which was in her bag. In the purse she had her credit card, student card and her allowance money which included taxi fare for the whole week and money for food at school. All I could do was just stand there and do nothing. This was one of the few times I’ve ever felt helpless in my life. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After taking everything they could get their hands on, they started walking away. But not without they one who took my stuff looking back at me, with the most intense of stares, as if to say if I got off lightly.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This was the first time I had ever been robbed. Even though I was acting like I wasn’t fazed while these guys were taking our stuff, I was in shock. But I realised that Nomthandazo had it worse than me as she had a gun to her face. I then went checked on her to make sure she was okay, but turns out she was okay, a bit shook but okay. I wanted to take a couple of minutes so we could calm down, but we both knew we couldn’t stay there as it was dangerous and another group could pop up and we would get robbed, again. So, we started walking towards the taxi rank, trying to process what just happened, while it started drizzling. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As we are walking, I realise she might not have money to get home and she says no, so I then reach into the small pocket in my jean and take out a R100 from the money my mom gave me and gave it to her to use it for taxi fare to get home. I knew my mom would understand. We got to the taxi rank, and before we separated, we hugged each other without any concern whether people were watching. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I don’t want to end the story on a sad note so here’s something I found funny. After Nomthandazo and I parted ways, and I was in the taxi heading home, if you had seen me, you would have thought that maybe my boyfriend had broken up with me or something because of the way I was looking out the window, into space as it was raining. While in actual fact, even though I had gone through something that some might consider traumatic, all I could think about was how those guys who took my phone, and as a result forced me to listen to the people in the taxi talk non-stop, going on and on about random things and I could do nothing about it as I couldn’t put my earphones on and block them out. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            And that is my story of the first time I ever got robbed. Funny enough, as soon as these guys walked away, a cop car passed us on the bridge. How ironic.
