        <h2>A reflection on Bush, V. ‘As we may Think’</h2>
        <p>“There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as 
            specialization extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other 
            workers—conclusions which he cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear. Yet specialization
            becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly
            superficial” [1].

        <h2>The Promise and Peril of User Generated Content</h2>
        <p>We live in an age where almost everyone on earth has a smartphone. Smartphones have changed the way we live, 
           from the time we wake up to the time we go to sleep, smartphones are with us all the way. They help us in doing
           many jobs that earlier required efforts and consumed our precious time. And through the installation of apps, the 
           list of possible smartphone uses multiples by tens of thousands and grows every day.

        <h2>A reflection on McLuhan, M. ‘The Medium is the Message’</h2>
        <p>
            “The medium is the message”. This is a phrase that many people, including myself have struggled to comprehend. 
            It is a phrase coined by Marshall McLuhan, a Canadian philosopher, whose work is among the cornerstones of the 
            study of media theory. The phrase serves as the title of  the first  chapter of his book, Understanding Media: 
            The Extensions of Man, published in 1964. The book is considered a pioneering study in media theory.

        <h2>How does the Medium is the Message impact our understanding of the web</h2>
        <p>
            To properly answer this question, we need to first understand where the phrase comes from and what it means. It

            study of media theory. The phrase serves as the title of  the first  chapter of his book, Understanding Media:

        <h2>The Importance of Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
            To properly explore the concept of accessibility, and why it is important, we need to first ask ourselves, what
            is accessibility? more specifically, website accessibility? When answering this question, most people, myself 
            included, usually think of website accessibility only with regards to people living with disabilities and affording
            them the same opportunity, with regards to usability as everyone else when accessing a website, despite of their 
            conditions.
