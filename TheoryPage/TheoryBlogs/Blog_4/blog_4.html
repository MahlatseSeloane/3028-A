                <p>
                    To properly answer this question, we need to first understand where the phrase comes from and what it means. It is a 
                    phrase coined by Marshall McLuhan, a Canadian philosopher, whose work is among the cornerstones of the study of media 
                    theory. The phrase serves as the title of  the first  chapter of his book, Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man, 
                    published in 1964. The book is considered a pioneering study in media theory.
                </p>

                <p>
                    McLuhan uses the phrase to encompass everything that he talks about in the book, in which he explores the relationship 
                    between the mass media and audiences. "In a culture like ours, long accustomed to splitting and dividing all things as 
                    a means of control, it is sometimes a bit of a shock to be reminded that, in operational and practical fact, the medium 
                    is the message. This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium - that is, of any 
                    extension of ourselves - result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, 
                    or by any new technology" [1].
                </p>

                <p>
                    For McLuhan, technology has changed the way we perceive and interact with the world. He says that as much as we have 
                    shaped the tools we use, they have also shaped us regarding how we interact with the world thereafter. This is very true
                    especially considering the age we are living in, the age of technology. Whether this is for better or worse, is a 
                    different discussion entirely. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    A great example of such technology is the web, also referred to as the Internet. Its creation has drastically changed the
                    way we interact with one another, and with society at large. It has become part of our everyday lives, not only serving as 
                    a mechanism to access information, but also as a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals regardless 
                    of their geographic location [2]. The latter is one aspect of the internet, which can be associated with social media.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the internet, social media platforms serve as an extension of ourselves as they allow for social relations between 
                    people, through uploading pictures and videos, instant messaging and commenting on actions taken by other users, anywhere 
                    in the world. But with different social media platforms, comes different forms of communication. What does this mean? It 
                    means that depending on which social media platform, or better yet, any aspect of the web, the way we communicate is 
                    informed by that platform. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, let’s use the platform Twitter. Twitter is a microblogging and social networking service where users can post 
                    and interact with messages from other users, known as "tweets" through liking and retweet tweeting them [3]. It has a 
                    280-character limit that forces people to be quick and to the point when writing a message, oftentimes sacrificing a lot of 
                    context in the process. Although it does allow users to write a chain of tweets called a thread, it means that the first 
                    tweet of the thread needs to grab another user’s attention for them to continue reading the rest of the thread.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Therefore, it can be said that such a medium, as well as many others, places a filter on a message in a way that 
                    significantly influences how a message is communicated and interpreted.  
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    ““The medium is the message”, is a phrase that sums up a much deeper communication theory, which is that the medium through 
                    which we choose to communicate holds as much, if not more, value than the message itself” [4].
