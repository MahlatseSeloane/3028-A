        <h1>A reflection on McLuhan, M. ‘The Medium is the Message’</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>
            “The medium is the message”. This is a phrase that many people, including myself have struggled to comprehend. It is
            a phrase coined by Marshall McLuhan, a Canadian philosopher, whose work is among the cornerstones of the study of 
            media theory. The phrase serves as the title of  the first  chapter of his book, Understanding Media: The Extensions
            of Man, published in 1964. The book is considered a pioneering study in media theory. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Unfortunately, the meaning to this phrase is not at all obvious. Does it mean that regardless of the message being 
            communicated through a medium, it should be ignored as the medium itself is the message? Or does it mean that the 
            medium through which a message is communicated is more important than the message itself? How can the medium be its 
            own message? 
        </p>

        <p>
            Because we presume the conventional meaning for "medium" that refers to the mass-media of communications - radio, 
            television, the press, the Internet and combine it with our conventional understanding of "message" as content or 
            information. Putting the two together makes us to jump to these mistaken conclusions. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Therefore, by letting go of the conventional meanings we have of these words, it becomes clear that with the phrase,
            “The medium is the message”, McLuhan is questioning and exploring how the media (radio, television, internet, etc), 
            not the content that they carry, should be the focus of study [1]. “The content or uses of such media are as diverse 
            as they are ineffectual in shaping the form of human association. Indeed, it is only too typical that the ‘content’ 
            of any medium blinds us to the character of the medium” [2]. This also is made clear as you go through his book.
        </p>

        <p>
            He suggests that because we, as a society are unable to differentiate between the content and character of a medium, 
            we have become oblivious to how the medium affects the way in which we interact with one another, and with society at
            large. This is also fuelled by the fact that whenever we create - be it an invention or a new idea - we generally focus
             on what that invention is intended to do, and what it might replace without taking into consideration the conditions 
             that exist in our society and the unintended consequences that may result through the interplay of the invention and 
             those conditions. And because most of the time, these effects are introduced subtly, or over long periods of time, it 
             makes it harder to be aware of them until after them have taken effect.
        </p>

        <p>
            An example of such a medium is the Internet. Its creation has drastically changed the way we interact with one another, 
            and with society at large. It has become part of our everyday lives, not only serving as a mechanism to access 
            information, but also as a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals regardless of their geographic 
            location [3]. The latter is one aspect of the internet, which can be associated with social networks, also referred to 
            as social media. 
        </p>

        <p>
            On the internet, social media platforms serve as an extension of ourselves as they allow for social relations between 
            people, usually as active members of the platform, with common interests or activities. They generally involve creating
             profiles, uploading pictures and videos, instant messaging and commenting on actions taken by other members. 
        </p>

        <p>
            But as stated by McLuhan, because of our inability to consider the conditions that exist in our society, other than the
             good that they bring, there have been some unintended consequences that social media has brought with it. Amongst other
              things, it has been linked to higher levels of loneliness, envy, anxiety, depression, narcissism and decreased social 
              skills [4]. One of the reasons for this is because of our human characteristic to compare, which is an important 
              characteristic of human social life. But oftentimes, it can be self-destructive, especially in the age we live in.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This is because most people, intentionally or unintentionally, compare aspects of their lives (appearance, 
            accomplishments, and personality traits) to the narratives that the other people, be it family, friends, and sometimes 
            even strangers share and portray on social media. And most times, these narratives are positive and celebratory and serve
             as a highlight reel. We forget that people on social media, including ourselves, usually emphasize the best versions of 
             themselves instead of the real versions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Therefore, it is all the more important to heed McLuhan’s words when he wrote, "This is merely to say that the personal 
            and social consequences of any medium - that is, of any extension of ourselves - result from the new scale that is 
            introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology" [2].
