        <h1>The Importance of Accessibility</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>
            To properly explore the concept of accessibility, and why it is important, we need to first ask ourselves, what is 
            accessibility? more specifically, website accessibility? When answering this question, most people, myself included, 
            usually think of website accessibility only with regards to people living with disabilities and affording them the 
            same opportunity, with regards to usability as everyone else when accessing a website, despite of their conditions.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Although this is something that should be done regardless, this answer is partly correct. Website accessibility does 
            not just speak to making a website usable for disabled people, but also making it usable to anyone who has access to 
            the internet and can navigate it [1]. This includes young and old people, those that suffer from colour blindness, 
            intellectual disabilities, and dyslexia, and so much more. So, what does this mean? Well, it means that as a web 
            designer, one needs to consider a multitude of conditions for their website to be useful to not just a select group 
            of people, but any and everybody who comes across their website. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Considering and possibly catering for these conditions has several advantages for web designers and their websites. 
            These may include:
        </p>

        <p>
            an increase in the quality of the website and as a result as customer satisfaction
        </p>
        
        <p>
            an improvement in the website’s positioning during searches on search engines such as google, which may also in turn 
            result in a possible increase of visits to the website as it is now able to reach a much larger number of users. 
        </p>

        <p>
            But unfortunately, ensuring website accessibility is still not common practice.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is because knowledge about accessibility is not yet widespread. Many designers, including some that have been in 
            the industry for a long time now, have not even heard about practices for improving website accessibility. Not everyone 
            is aware of how many benefits website accessibility brings for a small price. Below are some accessibility mistakes 
            from TestArmy, that most web designers, especially professional make:
        </p>

        <p>
            Flashing elements, such as advertisements as an element blinking multiple time per second may even trigger an 
            epileptic attack.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            No alternatives to video and audio material. Deaf and hearing-impaired people are unable to use such materials. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Too complicated a language. Most people such as foreigners find the language used too complex as they are not from that 
            region or are unfamiliar with it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Buttons that are too small and hard to press/aim at are a problem not only for people with disabilities but also for the 
            elderly.
        </p>

        <p>
            Time limit to perform an action. Some users, for whatever random reasons, need more time to perform basic activities. If 
            a time limit is necessary for a particular website, the user should be able to turn the countdown off or extend the limit.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ensuring websites are accessible and usable for everyone prevents digital exclusion of a large group of users and should 
            be of concern for anyone who works within the online space. Although technology in and of itself is meant to remove 
            certain barriers, allowing, among other things, remote contact, or remote working, the choices that web designers take 
            ultimately decide this remains true or not.
