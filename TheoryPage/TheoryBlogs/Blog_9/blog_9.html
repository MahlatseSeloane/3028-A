                    Technology and the internet are powerful tools that have changed the way we live; from the time we wake up to the time 
                    we go to sleep. they have provided endless opportunities to many and allow us to connect in ways we never thought 
                    possible. Despite incredible advancements in technology and the good it has brought us, surprisingly enough, these 
                    innovations are not accessible to everybody. There are still those that do not have access to technologies such as a 
                    computer or cell phone, let alone seen them. If they do have them, they do not have access to internet to connect with 
                    the rest of the world. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    And thanks to the pandemic that we are currently facing, this has never been more apparent. Much of the world has gone now virtual as the pandemic has caused a complete shutdown to the usual way of life. People have been forced to stay indoors, work from home and buy food and necessities online. 

                <p>
                    Schools have been forced to implement remote learning, where students are expected to watch lectures through online platforms such as Microsoft teams or Zoom, and as such require devices such as a computer or cell phone and a proper internet connection. But unfortunately, not everyone has access to these things [1]. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is what is called a digital divide. To properly understand who it affects and how, we first need to know what this phenomenon is. The digital divide is the gap that exists between people who have access to technology, the internet and digital literacy training and those who do not [2]. Although access is the major contributing factor of the digital divide, there are other factors that contribute which include the following: Income levels, education and digital literacy, geography as well as disability.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Levels:</strong> The income gap plays a major role in widening the digital divide. High income families are more likely to have access to internet or own computers and high-speed internet connection at home. For low-income families, the money they earn are most likely to be channelled towards basic needs, therefore technology is a luxury.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Education and Digital Literacy:</strong> Students who attend schools with sufficient computers and learn the necessary digital skills have an upper advantage over students who are not exposed to these technologies at an early age. This lack access to technology widens the gap between the information rich and information poor even further.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Geography:</strong> Unlike more economically developed countries, less economically developed countries lack the finances, necessary technology, and infrastructure to set up a high-speed internet connection. On top of that, considering where one stays in those countries, the divide can increase exponentially. In urban areas, people are more likely to have access to 4G or fibre optic internet than rural areas.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Disability:</strong> Those living with physical disabilities are often not considered and catered for when it comes to accessing the internet. They may have the necessary skills but cannot exploit the available hardware and software, therefore creating barriers for perceiving, understanding, and navigating the internet.
