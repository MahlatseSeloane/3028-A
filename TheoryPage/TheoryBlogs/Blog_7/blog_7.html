                            When it comes to web design, usability and accessibility are some of a few elements that need to be considered by a 
                            designer, as they make up a big part of UX (User Experience). Other elements also include design and system 
                            performance. These 4 are the most notable elements that form part of the UX [1]. Although usability and accessibility 
                            share a few principles and as a result lead to non-designers and sometimes designers themselves confusing the two and 
                            using them interchangeable, they are not the same.  
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            Below we will explore their differences as well as why they are important when it comes to the web. But first, to explore those differences, we need to understand what usability and accessibility are regarding the web. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>What is web usability?</h3>
                        <p>
                            In simple words, web usability can be defined as is the ease with which users can navigate intuitively on the web/webpage without wondering how and where to find things they want [1]. According to the Nielsen Norman Group, a leader in the user experience field and co-founded by Dom Norman, who is the author of the book The Design of Everyday Things, a designer needs to ask themselves these questions when implementing usability on the web:
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>How quickly users <strong>learn</strong> how to navigate the webpage? </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    After grasping how to navigate the webpage, how easy it is for users to achieve tasks? 
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>How easy it is for users to use the app from <strong>memory</strong> after not using it for a while?</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    4.	How many and what are the <strong>errors</strong> do users make and how easy it is them to recover from <strong>errors</strong>? 
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>5.	Does using the app bring <strong>satisfaction</strong> to the users?</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>
                            But unfortunately, ensuring website accessibility is still not common practice.
                        </p>
        
                        <h3>What is web accessibility?  </h3>
                        <p>
                            When it comes to web accessibility, most people, including myself, usually think of web accessibility only with regards to people living with disabilities and making it easier for them to use the web. Although this is something that should be done regardless, this answer is partly correct. Web accessibility can be defined as making the web/website usable by anyone who has access to the internet, including people living with disabilities [2]. The aim of accessibility is to remove barriers for perceiving, understanding, and navigating the web/website and ensuring that it does not whole groups of people.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            From these definitions, it is evident that usability and accessibility are similar but different and that usability includes accessibility, but accessibility does not include usability. A website that is usable is most likely accessible, but a website that is accessible can be difficult to use if the ‘accessibility’ is from a technical standpoint only [3].  
                        </p>

                        <h3>Why usability and accessibility are important on the web?</h3>
                        <p>
                            As a designer, one can have the most amazing website, but if their design excludes a whole group of people, then the website isn’t living up to its full potential. Therefore, It is important that designers consider usability and accessibility during the design process because by implementing best practices of these elements, they give users the best experience possible and users will leave their website with a sense of satisfaction.
