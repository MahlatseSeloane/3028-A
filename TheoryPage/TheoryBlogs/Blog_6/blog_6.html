                        <p>
                            UI and UX design have grown substantially over the past few decades and with this growth, ways to analyse and critique 
                            them have been created and perfected. In this blog post, we will discuss these methods, how they are used to improve UX 
                            and UI designs of a product, service or webpage, and why this is important. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But before we do that, we first need to understand what is meant by UX and UI. Below are their definitions. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            UX is the internal experience that a user feels as they interact with every aspect of a product, service or webpage [1]. 
                            According to cognitive scientist Don Norman, who came up with the term, User Experience, “UX encompasses all aspects of 
                            the end-user’s interaction with the company, its service, and its products.”. It is important to not, without UI though, 
                            UX would not exist as UX is the direct result of the improvement of UI. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            UI is the series of screens, pages, and vital elements such as buttons and icons, that allow the user to interact with 
                            the product, service or webpage [1]. UI has come a long way considering back in the 1970s, only a select few cold use a 
                            computer as you would have to use the command line interface which meant you had to have experience with code. Today, 
                            because of the development of the graphical user interface, we can interact with computer via visual elements such as 
                            buttons, icons, menus, etc. And as a result, computer manufacturers now design these technologies with users in mind.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now that we understand what these terms are, we can look at the ways in which they are analysed and critiqued.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To better analyse these elements, one first needs to consider which segments to focus on. They need to choose a metric of 
                            success, consider which use cases they are going to focus on, and go through the user flow. This must be backed by user 
                            research, such as observing data analytics results or a previous usability study. Only then will they be able to effectively 
                            analyse and critic UX and UI [2].
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Methods of analysis:
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Consider user expectations</h4> 

                                <p>
                                    Considering what the user perceives and expects is an important method of analysis as it helps you cater for the needs 
                                    properly. This is done by asking a number of questions such as:
                                </p>
            
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Does each step and screen communicate what it is supposed to?</li>
                                    <li>Is it obvious to the user what they need to do to complete a task?</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <h4>Evaluate usability heuristics</h4>

                                <p>
                                    A heuristics evaluation is a list of design rules of thumb that rely on convention, standards, and best practices to 
                                    improve a product’s overall usability. Doing this enables you to find usability problems so that they can be attended to 
                                    as part of an iterative design process [3].
                                </p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <h4>Analyse the number of steps in the user flow</h4>
                                <p>
                                    A user flow is a path taken by a prototypical user on a website or app to complete a task [4]. Therefore, by counting the 
                                    number of interaction steps it takes to complete a task, you can determine the complexity that comes with completing that 
                                    task and whether a step needs to be taken out.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                            <li>

                                <h4>Evaluate the product structure</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Considering where the features of the product are and how easy it is to switch between them, helps identify how effectively 
                                    a user can complete a task which often corresponds to their satisfaction with the quality of the experience. 
                                </p>
                            </li>
