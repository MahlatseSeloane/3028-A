                    “There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as 
                    specialization extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other 
                    workers—conclusions which he cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear. Yet specialization 
                    becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly 
                    superficial” [1].
                </p>

                <p>
                    These are the words of Vannevar Bush, from an article “As We May Think”, written in The Atlantic. Bush was the 
                    director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development in 1945, and whose job was to coordinate the work of 
                    about six thousand scientists in the war effort. Bush was instrumental in the development of the atomic bomb and 
                    the analogue computer [2]. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the article, Bush addresses the question of what scientists who contributed to the war should turn their focus 
                    too, as the war was coming to an end. He also tries to imagine a new use and a new future for some of the 
                    technologies that were used to wage war for the past decade. As he writes, he brings up a problem that he thinks is 
                    worth of the talents and efforts of the scientists in question, a problem pertaining to the access and communication 
                    of information in a valuable way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the article he says, “Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the results of research are 
                    generations old and by now are totally inadequate for their purpose… The summation of human experience is being 
                    expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily 
                    important item is the same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships” [1]. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In an attempt to try and tackle this problem, he goes on to conceptualizes a hypothetical information database, in 
                    the form of a mechanical machine. This machine, called the “memex”, would work by way of associations and hyper 
                    textuality. It would create “trails” of associated information and allow one to create and share collections of 
                    connected data which would not only be more intuitive but would rapidly increase the speed and depth of research and
                    information sharing [3]. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    If one were to look to the present day, it is clear that Bush’s concept of the “memex” served as the blueprint to what
                    we know today as the world wide web, also called the internet. It is the embodiment of Bush’s vision, as it is the 
                    perfect form of a record that allows knowledge to evolve and endure throughout the life of a race rather than that 
                    of an individual. Much like Bush envisioned, it allows for information, which is stored on it, to be consulted, and 
                    extended upon. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The internet has because part of our everyday lives, not only serving as a mechanism to access information, but also 
                    as a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals regardless of their geographic location [4]. Even 
                    though Bush’s vision has come to pass, and the internet symbolizes next step of evolution for the human race in terms 
                    of technology, we are still a long way to perfecting the way we use the it as it comes with pros and cons that we do 
                    not fully understand as of yet.
