                            The character of Kgothatso Modupe from the most famous township in the world, Soweto, was conceptualized after I had watched the 
                            show Black Tax on BET Africa on channel 129 on DSTV. The show tells the story of Thuli, a successful professional black woman and
                            single mother of a teenage girl, living in a modest suburban townhouse. Suddenly her parents arrive on her doorstep, in need of a 
                            place to stay. She now has to juggle being a single mom, her demanding job as well as her crazy family. The show is meant to 
                            explore the unspoken law of payback to the community of people that helped her get to where she is, Black Tax.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After hearing praises for the show, I went in excited and high expectations, as I thought the show will explore a subject that is 
                            a reality for most black people in South Africa, especially the youth. Instead, after watching a couple of episodes, I found myself 
                            unable to finish the rest of the show. Normally if I do not like a show, I would simply stop watching it and eventually forget about 
                            it, but this was not the case. When it came to this show, I was bothered by it and unable to remove it out of my mind. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I had felt that the writers of the show had done a disservice to the subject at hand as well as the viewers because this was an 
                            opportunity to challenge the audience and offer insights into the uncensored disdain that comes with black tax. It felt as if the 
                            creators of the show did not really try to explore the subject, nor did they seem interested in doing so, as reflected by the show’s 
                            premise. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            With it’s premise, it is clear that it was intended to be watched by viewers who wanted to switch off the minds and pass the time. 
                            The show’s premise uses the subject as a means to get a quick laugh by recycling the same comedic tactics used by shows a decade ago, 
                            most notably City ses’la, Thandeka’s dairy and others like them. At the time, these shows were good television and most people enjoyed 
                            them, myself included, but we cannot expect the same tactics used a decade ago to still work now. The show is a reflection of the 
                            writing stuff, and how there was a lack of people who understood, let alone experienced black tax in any form, as a phenomenon that 
                            plagues most South Africans, and the challenges that come with it.

                            The character Kgothatso is meant to represent a typical young adult that one would find in the streets of Soweto, faced with multiple 
                            issues that normally plague those that live in the township, issues ranging from firstborn children taking on the responsibility of a 
                            guardian, one’s home being open to people far removed from the immediate family or sending a portion of a bursary stipend home.
